            That sounds great. I’d be happy with that.

            Could you send over some pictures of your dog, please?

            Here are a few pictures. She’s a happy girl!

            Can you make it?

            She looks so happy! The time we discussed works. How long shall I take her out for?

            30 minute walk
            $29

            1 hour walk
            $49

            Type a message…
